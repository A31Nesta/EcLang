        A class in EcLang.
        Classes in EcLang are structures with a specific name
        that can contain attributes. These attributes can be of 
        the following types:

        - INT8   -> (byte, char, int8, int8_t)
        - INT16  -> (short, int16, int16_t)
        - INT32  -> (int, int32, int32_t)
        - INT64  -> (long, int64, int64_t)

        - UINT8  -> (uint8, uint8_t)
        - UINT16 -> (uint16, uint16_t)
        - UINT32 -> (uint32, uint32_t)
        - UINT64 -> (uint64, uint64_t)

        - FLOAT  -> (float)
        - DOUBLE -> (double)

        - STRING -> (string)
        - STR_MD -> (str_md)
